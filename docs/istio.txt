service mesh : helps to you with traffic management of k8 cluster

why service mesh : 
w-e traffic management ---> add mutual tls (secure service to service traffic)
making deployment strategies easy 
having observability setup 
circuit breaking

how istio is implemented :
sidecar (has envoy proxy ) ---> attachs a container that sits next to k8 pod
--> handles traffic (goes or comes through it )


istiod ---> get all data from these side car containers

admission controller , they will come in between api server and etcd and gets the data 
(they will modify the data going into etcd)
